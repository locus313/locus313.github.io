Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Patrick Lewis
I am a passionate IT Systems Engineer and Network administrator.
I don't consider myself a developer since I work way better with operating systems, shells, network appliances but I do contribute to various open-source projects.

Here you will find documentation for various projects or things I wanted to document on how i solved the problem.

If you see something that needs to be fixed, or have a different soluton and would like to suggest a change. This documentation is open source!  Feel free to open an issue or PR [here](https://github.com/locus313/locus313.github.io).
